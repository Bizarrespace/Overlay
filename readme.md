## Idea of this project is to make a general overlay for the use of games

* At times when playing games there is an item that needs various components that one must gather, and there are some games that do not have a tracking system or the system is buried in a menu that is not convinent
* This overlay makes it so there is a simple commands that will instantly let the player know what they need, or if the player wants the overlay to stay on top of their game in the corner that would happen as well 

# TODOs:
* Make it so it is the overlay, and then various other components such as todo list and what not be separate from the overlay itself
* Add ability to add images as one of the components
* Have a settings page where the user can change the commands used to close the program, or set another set of keys to hide/unhide the overlay
